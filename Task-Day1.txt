    from client to server or vice-versa                     from client to server or vice-versa
    * It blocks other requests until you get the response * Here we can do mutiple requests and responses 
    to the current request                                   at the same time,so it doesn't block any requests or responses
    * It compress data by itself                          * It compress data using HPACK

    };
