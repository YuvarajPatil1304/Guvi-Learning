1. For the given JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)
--> JSON:-
    var Person {
        Name: "XYZ";
        Age: X;
        Address:"XXX";
        Designation:"ABC";
    };

    1) for:
    var len = Person.length;
    for(var i=0;i<len;i++) {
        value = Person[i];
        console.log(key,value);
    }
    2) for in:
    for(var key in Person) {
        value = Person[key];
        console.log(key,value);
    }
    3) for of:
    for(var key of Person) {
        value = Person[key];
        console.log(key,value);
    }
    4) for each:
    Object.entries(Person).forEach([key,value]) => {
        console.log(key,value);
    }

2. Create your own resume data in JSON format.
--> 
    {
        "Resume_Name" : [
            {
                "Name":"Sai Yuvaraj Patil",

                "Training":"Full-Stack Development(MERN)",
                "Primery Skills":"C,C++,Javascript,Python",
                "Experience":"7 months"
            }
        ]
    }
